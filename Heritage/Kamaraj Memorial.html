            Kanyakumari is located at 8.08°N 77.57°E. It has an average elevation of 300 metre. Contrary to the popular (and sensational) belief that Kanyakumari lies at the meeting point of three bodies of water, it borders only one: the Laccadive Sea to the south west, south, and to the southeast. It is the confluence of the Western Coastal Plains and Eastern Coastal Plains.<br><br>
            It is located at the southern tip and southernmost point of the Indian Subcontinent. However, the southernmost point of the Republic of India is at Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island, at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E.<br><br>
            Kanyakumari is used geographically to define southern end of the Coromandel Coast region.
