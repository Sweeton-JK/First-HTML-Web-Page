            It was constructed in the 18th century by Punachal/Elakkara Valiyaveetil Marthandan Chempakaraman Pillai for the kings of Travancore. Marthanda Pillai was born in an aristocratic house in Punachal Elakkara near Kuzhikode near Palliyadi in Kanyakumari district. (Then South Travancore). The house was a house that was associated with the royal family. Marthanda Pillai was born in the month of May 903 in Bharani Nakshatra, the son of Neelamma Pillai, a member of the said house, and Iravikurup, the bodyguard of Marthanda Varma. Later it was modified under the supervision of Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, an ex-Dutch naval officer of the Dutch East India Company, who became commander of the Travancore Army (the very army that defeated him in the Battle of Colachel) in the 18th century, after he earned the trust of the Travancore King Marthanda Varma. De Lannoy reconstructed Vattakottai, as part of the defence-fortifications he undertook throughout Travancore.<br><br>
            The fort is made of granite blocks and, today, a part of the fort extends into the sea. It is a protected site under the Indian archaeological department. A major renovation of the fort was undertaken recently by the department, and the site is now a popular tourist spot.<br><br>
            Vattakottai Fort commands a picturesque view of both the sea on the one side, and the hills (Western Ghats) on the other. Another interesting feature near the site is a beach of black sands. It is about 7 km (4.3 mi) from Kanyakumari town.

            Vattakottai Fort is an 18th century fortress which is located in Kanyakumari town in Kanyakumari district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The geographical coordinates of the fort are latitude 8.125&#176;N and longitude 77.565&#176;E. It was built as a coastal defence fortification under the management of Captain Eustachius De Lannoy of the Dutch East India Company in Kingdom of Travancore. Captain De Lannoy was a former Dutch naval officer. He was appointed as the Commander of the Army of Travancore Kingdom by King Marthanda Varma in the 18th century. Eustachius De Lannoy built the Vattakottai Fort in order to develop defence fortifications throughout the region. The structure is constructed with large blocks of granite.<br><br>
            At present, the fortress is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). As the fort is in a ruined state, thus parts of the building are being renovated by the Government of India. Moreover, the site has been developed as a tourist destination.
