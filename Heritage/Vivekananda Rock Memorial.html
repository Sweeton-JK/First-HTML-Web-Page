            Swami Vivekananda visited Kanyakumari on December 24, 1892, prior to his Chicago trip to take part in the 1893 ‘World Religious Conference’. It is said that he meditated on the rock for two days and attained enlightenment. He was one of the eminent disciples of Ramakrishna, an Indian mystic and yogi of the 19th century, and later played an instrumental role in introducing Indian philosophies of Yoga and Vedanta to the Western countries. In January 1962, marking the birth centenary of Swamiji, the ‘Kanyakumari Committee’ was set up by a group of people who aimed at establishing a memorial of Swamiji on the rock as also a bridge for people to visit the rock. The ‘Ramakrishna Mission’ in Madras also conceived of such a memorial during that time. However the concept met with certain hurdles with the local Catholic fishermen displaying aversion and putting up a big Cross on the rock and on the other hand the Hindus were protesting such move of the Catholic populace. As matters became worse, the rock was marked as a prohibited place and armed guards were stationed to patrol it. On January 17, 1963 as permitted by the government, a tablet was put up at the rock that mentioned its association with Swami Vivekananda.<br><br>
            Eknath Ramkrishna Ranade, an eminent Indian social and spiritual reformer and a senior pracharak of the ‘Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’ (RSS) who was profoundly influenced by the teachings of Swamiji played an instrumental role in setting up the memorial. He set up the ‘Vivekananda Rock Memorial Organising Committee’ that soon opened up several branches in India to garner support and raise funds in pursuit of establishing the memorial. As political hurdles cropped up including rejection of the concept by Humayun Kabir, the then Minister of Education and Culture, as also from Chief Minister of Madras state, Minjur Bhaktavatsalam,  Ranade went on to collect signatures of 323 Members of Parliament in support of the memorial following which the then Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi approved the project. The construction of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial was completed in a short span of six years in 1970, which involved around 650 workers. It was inaugurated and dedicated to the nation in that year.

            Vivekananda Memorial is situated near the city of Kanyakumari, which lies at the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula. The meeting point of Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, the city is known for its breathtaking sunrises and sunsets. It is in the sea that we see a rocky islet, at a distance of approximately 400 m from the shore. On this islet stands a magnificent monument called the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, dedicated to Swami Vivekananda, a leader, a philosopher a social reformer.<br><br>

The memorial was built under the aegis of the Vivekananda Memorial Committee. It dates back to the year 1970 and was built in the commemoration of the visit of the great leader to the islet. Swami Vivekananda visited the city of Kanyakumari in 1892. One day, he swam in the sea and reached the islet. He stayed there for an entire night and kept on meditating. It is believed that it was here that he received enlightenment. The Vivekanand Rock Memorial was later erected in honor of his visit.<br><br>
Sthapati Sri S.K. Achari was the architect of the memorial, which was later consecrated by Srimad Swami Vireshwarananda, the President of Ramakrishna Mission. The official inauguration ceremony of the monument was held in September 1970 and it was conducted by Sri. V.V. Giri, the then President of India. There are two main structures that make up the entire complex of the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, namely Vivekananda Mandapam and Shripada Mandapam.
