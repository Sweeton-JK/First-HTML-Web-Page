        <p>The small village, Padmanabhapuram originally known as Kalkulam, in Kanyakumari district was once a thriving capital of the powerful Venad Kingdom which later became popular as the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. Padmanabhapuram was not the first stronghold of the Venad rulers in the South. The nearby Valliyur, Veerakeralaeswaram (also known as Veerakeralapuram), Thiruvithamcode, Charode, Puliyoorkurichi (Udayagiri), and Eraniel still have remnants of settlements, palaces, old fortifications and major temples that predate the foundation of Padmanabhapuram. Today there is no trace of the old palace in Keralapuram and Charode, but the ruins of a palace can still be seen in Eraniel. Kalkulam was probably chosen as an apt place for constructing a palace due to its strategic location and proximity to the rugged mountain ranges of the Western Ghats which provided natural protection to the palace and the settlements. The abundance of fertile farmland and plentiful supply of water were the major attractions that invited the royals and other settlers to this region.<br><br>

            Within the ancient Kalkulam fortification is the sprawling Padmanabhapuram Palace complex, an early administrative headquarters of the erstwhile Venad rulers. When searching for the roots of the fort and palace at Kalkulam one cannot overlook the Mudaliyar records which hint that the forts in Kalkulam and nearby Udayagiri came into existence just before 1600 A.D., during the reign of Iravi Varma Kulasekharan (r.1592-1609). John Nieuhoff, the seventeenth century Dutch traveller recorded: "Kalkulong (Kalkulam) is a very large city…being on one side strengthened by inaccessible mountains, on the other by wall, the under most of it is of stone, the uppermost of brickwork, in all 24 feet high, the royal palace stands at the west end, being surrounded by a stone wall."
