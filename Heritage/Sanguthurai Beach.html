            The beach also features gazebos, snack stalls and a children's park. It can be visited after sunset too as the beach is provided with adequate lighting facility.<br><br>
            this beach is a hidden gem. The beach looks like a painting come to life. Just the way a painter would paint an idyllic beach. The bluest of blue waters, the golden white sand, the horizon dotted with green coconut palms. And oh, the absence of litter. The water has a strong current, so splashing around in your swimming costume may not be a good idea. A better thing to do may be lazing around, with the waves lapping at your feet and watching the sunset. Or having a gala time clicking away at the surroundings.
