        Located near the shores of Kanyakumari, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial was built in the honour of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of our nation. Also known as Gandhi Mandapam, it is an important part for every Kanyakumari tour, presenting a glimpse into the historical richness of India and into life of the great man that India had seen.<br><br>
        Mahatma Gandhi has visited Kanyakumari twice, in the year of 1925 and then in 1937. After his demise in 1948, his ashes were kept in 12 different urns so as to transfer them to different parts of the country. One of these urns was brought to Kanyakumari. Before immersions, it was kept at the spot where the memorial is built now for public so that they can pay their last homage to one of the greatest sons of India. Later the ashes were immersed in the sea waters at Kanyakumari. Later Mahatma Gandhi Memorial or Gandhi Mandapam was built at the same place.<br><br>
        The construction of Gandhi Memorial was completed in the year of 1956. An excellent example of modern architecture, it draws inspirations from Orissa style of architecture. The central spire of this mandapam with pink portico has a height of 79 feet which is symbolic of the age of Mahatma Gandhi at the time of his demise. The most striking feature of Gandhi Mandapam is the ceiling of the building. It has an opening that has been built in such a way that on every 2nd October which is the broth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, rays of Sun falls exactly on the spot where his ashes were kept.

        Kanyakumari is located at 8.08°N 77.57°E. It has an average elevation of 300 metre. Contrary to the popular (and sensational) belief that Kanyakumari lies at the meeting point of three bodies of water, it borders only one: the Laccadive Sea to the south west, south, and to the southeast. It is the confluence of the Western Coastal Plains and Eastern Coastal Plains.<br><br>
        It is located at the southern tip and southernmost point of the Indian Subcontinent. However, the southernmost point of the Republic of India is at Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island, at 6°45’10″N and 93°49’36″E.<br><br>
        Kanyakumari is used geographically to define southern end of the Coromandel Coast region.<br><br>
